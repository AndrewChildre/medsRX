# Discussion Response
*(put any discussion here)*

### Q1: What instructions will we need to properly interact with your code?
 I used Android Studio for the emulators needed. I would suggest doing the same, You can also use the directions in the readMe file as well.
 
 ### Q2: Were there any decision points you came across? Did you need to make any assumptions?
 There were many decision points that I had. 
 1. Should I use fonts?
 2. Should I change the icons?
 3. How Much time should I actually spend?
 4. Should I change my useState hook?
 5. How much should I depart from the original design?
 6. There were to many more to list.
 The assumtions that I made were.
 1. I could change the icons as long as it kept the theme of the original.
 2. I did go over time, I wanted to make sure that I was presenting a decent product.
 3. I should stick to the orginal design, with some minor modifications.
 4. I assumed the this would be used on ios and android devices.
 ### Q3: Were there any questions you would have asked if this was a real-world scenario?
 There were many that could use discussion.
 1. Should we trim down some content or move it to a new page? 
 2. Discuss some consistent color themes.
 3. Customize how you earn rewards.
 4. What do the numbers at the top right mean? 
 5. Customize options for the progress bars?
 6. Should we design a login page?
 
 ### Q4: How did you prioritize your time? If given a few more hours to improve this, what you would work on next and why?
 I prioritized my time with the layout and styling from the top down to the rewards section.
 I would spend more time with the functionality. I would link up most of the interconnected items to each other. I would complete the morning medication check mark functionality. It partly works.
 I would improve on my visuals and get better icons and fonts.
 
 ### Q5: If you have any feedback or reflections, please share them with us. For example, if you could redo these exercises, what would you have done differently?
 Reflections:
 I really appreciate the opportunity to work on this code challenge. I learned a lot in the process of working through the different sections of the dashboard. I'm going to keep working on it to see what I can do.
Things that I would have done different were. I would have split my time up better, and not get bogged down one one issue.
